Ubuntu-Server-in-a-Box
======================

This will set up an Ubuntu 11.10 Server base installation with
everything needed to run Django backed by Postgres database, running
in a virtual environment.

It assumes the Django app conforms to Lincoln Loop best practices for
Django installs. See:

* http://lincolnloop.com/django-best-practices/projects.html
* http://github.com/lincolnloop/django-startproject/tree/master/django_startproject

This is a work in progress, as it does not completely set everything up
yet.
